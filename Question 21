# Question 

# WAP to read two strings and perform concatenation and comparsion operations on it

# Code

# We ask the user for two strings
str1 = str(input("Enter sentence: "))
str2 = str(input("Enter sentence: "))

# We ask the user if they want to concatenate or compare the strings
userFunction = str(input("Concatenate or Compare: ")).lower()

# We use if and else statement for performing concatenation and comparison
if userFunction == 'concatenate':

    # We create a list which will contain the two strings given by the user
    combinedStrings = []
    
    # We add the strings entered by the user into this new list
    combinedStrings.append(str1)
    combinedStrings.append(str2)
    
    # Display the list
    print(combinedStrings)

elif userFunction == 'compare':
    
    # We will create two lists here that will store the characters of each string respectively and will compare them on that basis
    letters1 = []
    letters2 = []

    # Using for loop, we will append each character of string 1 and 2 into their own lists respesctively
    for letter in str1:
        letters1.append(letter)
    for letters in str2:
        letters2.append(letters)
    
    # Now we will use if statement to say that if the elements of each list is same, then the strings are equal otherwise they aren't equal
    if letters1 == letters2:
        print("Strings are same")
    else:
        print("Strings are different")

# By chance, if user enters something wrong
else:
    print("invalid")

# That's it, you're done
